# vuejsfirebase

An example app using **Vue**.js 2 and a **Firebase** database.

* **Vue** = easy connecting between data and interface.

* **Firebase** = easy app database setup (a real database, *not* a simulated local one). This is just one of the many services that Firebase can offer your app.

## Setup

Watch how to set it up here (step-by-step + explanations): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we4zuQIXmnw

## Useful Notes

See package.json for a list of things to make sure to have installed using npm (to fill that `node_modules` folder).

The 3 files to code inside of:
1. `main.js`
2. `App.vue`: fill in the config file to match your personal firebase database access keys etc.
3. `index.html`

Important commands:
* `vue init webpack vuejsfirebase` if you want to create the vue project from scratch.
* `cd vuejsfirebase` to get into the folder for npm commands to work.
* `npm install` and `npm install ...` to set up modules as needed.
* `npm run dev` to run the view in your browser.
